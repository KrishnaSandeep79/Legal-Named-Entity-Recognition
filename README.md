# NLP Legal Named Entity  Recognition

### Task Repo:  https://github.com/Legal-NLP-EkStep/legal_NER

### Introduction
Named Entity Recognition is the task of identifying and classifying named entities in unstructured text. In the legal domain, named entities of interest may include the case parties, judges, names of courts, case numbers, references to laws, etc. However, these named entities are peculiar and are not recognized by standard NER. In this project, we train the ALBERT model on Indian court judgment texts and evaluate its performance on the given dataset.

### Steps to run the project
1. Clone the Git Repo
2. Upload the nlp-project.ipynb, config_file.cfg, and the data to Kaggle (Recommended)
3. Select the Accelerator as GPU P100 and run the nlp-project.ipynb file

The output will look similar to this
